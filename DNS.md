# Client-Side DNS Exploration (nslookup, Caching, Wireshark)

## Objective

The goal is to follow Kuross and Ross' [DNS Wireshark lab](https://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/Wireshark_DNS_v9.pdf) to
- investigate DNS client behavior (query/response)
- use the nslookup tool
- learn about local DNS caching
- look at the DNS packet structure using Wireshark

---

### **1. nslookup Basics**
- **Purpose**: Query DNS servers for records (e.g., `Type=A` for IP, `Type=NS` for name servers, reverse lookup).
- **Command**: `nslookup [options] <name>`
  - Default: Queries local DNS server.
  - `-type=NS <domain>` → Returns authoritative name servers.
  - Reverse lookup: `nslookup <IP>` → Returns hostname.
- **Example Outputs**:
  - `www.nyu.edu` → IPv4/IPv6 addresses + responding server.
  - `nyu.edu` with `-type=NS` → Authoritative NS hosts + IPs (often non-authoritative if cached).
- **Key Observations**:
  - Local DNS server may iteratively query others (invisible to client).
  - Answers may be **non-authoritative** (from cache).

---

### **2. Hands-On nslookup Tasks**
1. **Find IP of `www.iitb.ac.in`**

       nslookup www.iitb.ac.in

- the IP address is `103.21.124.133`

2. **Identify responding DNS server IP**
- the IP address is `127.0.0.53`

3. **Authoritative or non-authoritative?**  
- The response header shows that it is **non-authoritative**.  

```
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.iitb.ac.in
Address: 103.21.124.133
```

4. **Find authoritative NS for `iit.ac.in`**  
   → `nslookup -type=NS iit.ac.in`  
   → To get NS IP: Query `Type=A` on returned NS hostname.

```
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

** server can't find iit.ac.in: NXDOMAIN
```

5. **Find authoritative NS for `google.com`**  

        nslookup -type=NS google.com

        Server:         127.0.0.53
        Address:        127.0.0.53#53
        
        Non-authoritative answer:
        google.com      nameserver = ns2.google.com.
        google.com      nameserver = ns4.google.com.
        google.com      nameserver = ns3.google.com.
        google.com      nameserver = ns1.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

6. **Find the NS IP for the returned NS hostname(s) for `google.com`**

        nslookup -type=A ns2.google.com

        Server:         127.0.0.53
        Address:        127.0.0.53#53
        
        Non-authoritative answer:
        Name:   ns2.google.com
        Address: 216.239.34.10

---

### **3. DNS Caching on Host**
- Hosts maintain **DNS resolver cache** (like browser cache).
- Checked **before** contacting local DNS server.
- **Clear cache**:
  - **Mac**: `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
  - **Windows**: `ipconfig /flushdns`
  - **Linux**: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` or `resolvectl flush-caches`

---

### **4. Wireshark DNS Tracing**

#### **Setup**
1. Clear DNS + browser cache.
2. Filter: `ip.addr == <your_IP>`
3. Visit: `http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/`
4. Capture packets.

11. The web page for the base file http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/ references the image object http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/header_graphic_book_8E_2.jpg , which, like the base webpage, is on gaia.cs.umass.edu.

This question will be answered using `dns-wireshark-trace1-1.pcapng` found in this Wireshark lab's [trace file zip](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces-9e.zip).  

- What is the packet number in the trace for the initial HTTP GET request for the base file http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/?

Last, let’s use nslookup to issue a command that will return a type NS DNS record,

- Start a Wireshark capture.  
- Enter the following command:

    nslookup -type=NS umass.edu

- Stop the Wireshark capture.  

```
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
umass.edu       nameserver = ns3.umass.edu.
umass.edu       nameserver = ns1.umass.edu.
umass.edu       nameserver = ns2.umass.edu.

## What I Learned
I learned how to
- see that DNS works on UDP port 53, by default
- know that UDP is the default for quick DNS queries and responses
- know that TCP is used for larger DNS transfers or when reliability is critical
- use the nslookup command to query DNS servers for records
- use the nslookup command to find the responding DNS server IP
- to distinguish authoritative or non-authoritative DNS servers
- find the NS (nameserver) IP addresses for a domain
- clear DNS cache on a host
- use Wireshark to trace DNS information, such as source and destination IP and port, and protocol
- the role of DNS query and response questions and answers
- how DNS caching blocks a follow-up HTTP request to a web server
- how to find the IP address of my default local DNS server
- use Wireshark to gather more info about DNS queries for NS records
